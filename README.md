## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used clamp for almost all of the dimensions on the desktop page. I used javacript to swap out the logo on the desktop page for the hamburger and close icons on the mobile page, so I didn't have to change the styling very much.

### Continued development

The code I used to compute the width of the arrow boxes was tricky and it produces a huge arrow box at some point, for reasons I don't understand.
